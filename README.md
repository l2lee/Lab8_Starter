1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project developement pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why?
- Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is because whenever we want push code onto our repo, we want to make sure that the changes made have at least some sort of quality. This is basically a sanity check to ensure that your changes are at least not screwing up some existing functionalities.
